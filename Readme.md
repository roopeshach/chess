# REEV CHESS

REEV CHESS is a chess game written in Python PyGame. It is a two player game. The game is played on a chessboard, which is a square array of 64 squares. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. Each of the six piece types moves differently. Pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's pieces, with the objective to 'checkmate' the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture. The game ends when checkmate is achieved, when the player resigns, or when the game is drawn.
